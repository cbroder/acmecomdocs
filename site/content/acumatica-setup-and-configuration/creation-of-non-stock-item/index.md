## 2.5 Creation of Non-Stock Items

### Navigation: Distribution > Inventory > Work Area > Non Stock Items

This is mostly the same as **Stock Item** creation. The only difference is under General Settings in **Item Classes**. The **Stock Item**  checkbox should be unchecked.

Once the above configuration is done, Non-Stock Items can be created.
